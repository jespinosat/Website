    "# The Financial Effects of Hospital System Affiliation\n",
    "\n",
    "This project answers the following question: **What is the effect on hospital financial performance when a hospital becomes affiliated with (or switches into) a hospital system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this effect is important because hospital system affiliation is often motivated by financial pressures, access to capital, and potential efficiency gains. At the same time, hospitals that choose to join systems may already differ systematically from those that remain independent, making careful empirical analysis essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, I use a hospital-level panel dataset and an event-study framework that compares hospitals before and after system entry, while controlling for hospital fixed effects, time effects, and other control variables. This approach allows me to isolate changes in financial performance that coincide with the timing of system affiliation, under the standard parallel-trends assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I find that hospital net income margins increase by approximately **2.3** percentage points in the year a hospital joins a system. This effect is  meaningful: the estimated increase is almost **twice as large (60%)** as the average net margin observed among treated hospitals before system entry."

    "In more technical terms, the goal of this project is to estimate the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** of hospital system affiliation on financial performance. Conceptually, the ATE compares a hospital’s financial outcomes after joining a system to the outcomes that same hospital would have experienced had it remained independent.\n",
    "Formally, let:\n",

    "To study both **pre-trends** and **dynamic post-treatment effects**, I estimate an event-study difference-in-differences model using a symmetric window around the treatment event. Specifically, I focus on a **±3-year window** around the first year in which a hospital enters a multi-hospital system, so event time takes values \\(k \\in \\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\\}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "I construct indicator variables for each event-time \\(k\\), but **omit \\(k = -1\\)** (the year immediately prior to system entry). Omitting this period normalizes the model so that it serves as the **baseline**, which implies that all event-study coefficients are interpreted **relative to the year just before treatment**. This normalization is standard in event-study designs and facilitates a clear interpretation of both pre-treatment and post-treatment dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event-study regression includes **hospital fixed effects** to absorb time-invariant differences across hospitals—such as persistent differences in size, mission, or market position—and **year fixed effects** to absorb shocks common to all hospitals in a given year, including policy changes and macroeconomic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I estimate two specifications. **Spec 1 (baseline)** includes only the event-time indicators and fixed effects. **Spec 2 (controls)** augments the baseline specification with time-varying hospital controls capturing scale, utilization, and payer mix, including licensed beds (*BED_LIC*), total discharges (*DIS_TOT*), total outpatient visits (*VIS_TOT*), and the shares of patient days attributable to Medi-Cal and Medicare (*mcal_share*), \\(*mcar_share*). These controls account for observable changes in hospital activity and payer composition over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard errors are **clustered at the hospital level** to allow for serial correlation in outcomes within hospitals. The primary credibility check in this framework is the pattern of the **lead coefficients** (event times \\(k<0\\)): estimates close to zero support the parallel trends assumption. The **post-treatment coefficients.** Event times $(k \\ge 0)$ trace out the dynamic effects of system entry on hospital financial outcomes.\n"

    "The event-study estimates provide a **direct test of the parallel trends assumption** underlying the difference-in-differences design. Across all outcomes, the pre-treatment coefficients (event times −3 and −2) are small and statistically insignificant, with no systematic upward or downward pattern. This absence of differential pre-trends supports the credibility of the identification strategy and suggests that treated and control hospitals followed similar trajectories prior to system entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-treatment dynamics differ across outcomes. For *operating margin, cost-to-charge ratios,* and *cost per discharge,* the estimated effects are generally imprecise and statistically insignificant, indicating limited evidence of sustained changes in operating efficiency or cost structure following system affiliation. While some point estimates suggest short-run declines in costs, these effects are not robust across specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, *net income margin* shows a clear and robust response at the time of treatment. The coefficient at event time 0 is positive and statistically significant in both specifications, indicating an immediate improvement in overall profitability upon system entry. This effect fades in subsequent years, pointing to a short-run financial stabilization effect rather than a persistent improvement. Given that net income margin is the only outcome with a statistically significant treatment effect, the remainder of the analysis focuses on this outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I plot the estimated event-study coefficients for net income margin together with their 95% confidence intervals, providing a visual summary of the regression results.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I declare a helper function that converts the event-time variable names (e.g., event_m3, event_0, event_p2) into their corresponding numeric values, so that coefficients can be plotted along a continuous event-time axis. For each specification—Spec1 (baseline) and Spec2 (with controls), the code extracts the estimated coefficients and confidence intervals from the regression output and orders them by event time. Then, I plot the results."

    "The plot displays point estimates for each event-time coefficient, with vertical error bars representing the 95% confidence intervals. Different colors distinguish the two specifications, allowing a direct comparison between the baseline model and the model that includes additional hospital controls. The horizontal line at zero represents no effect, while the vertical dashed line at event time −1 marks the omitted baseline period, so all coefficients are interpreted relative to the year immediately before system entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This event-study plot visually confirms the regression findings. The pre-treatment coefficients (event times less than zero) are clustered around zero and their confidence intervals overlap zero, indicating no evidence of differential pre-trends prior to system entry. This supports the parallel trends assumption underlying the difference-in-differences design.\n",

    "Now, let's turn to the Robustness Checks\n",
    "# 5. Robustness Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "I will test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trends (\"lead\") joint test:** This test formally assesses the parallel trends assumption, which is the key identifying condition for the event-study design.\n",
    "    - To achieve this, I jointly test whether the estimated coefficients on the pre-treatment event-time indicators (the leads) are equal to zero.\n",
    "    - Failure to reject this null hypothesis indicates that treated and control hospitals followed similar trends before system entry, supporting the validity of the difference-in-differences approach.\n",

    "Below, I estimate the shifted-event placebo regression, using net income margin as the outcome and the shifted event-time indicators as regressors, along with hospital and year fixed effects and clustered standard errors at the hospital level. Because the shifted event does not correspond to the true timing of system entry, a valid causal interpretation implies that these placebo coefficients should be close to zero and display no systematic post-event pattern. Observing null and patternless estimates around the fake event supports the interpretation that the main event-study results are tied to the actual timing of system affiliation rather than to underlying trends or anticipatory dynamics."

    "The shifted-event placebo reassigns the treatment date to occur three years earlier for hospitals that eventually join a system, providing a falsification test for whether the estimated dynamics are driven by the true timing of system entry. In both specifications, the coefficients at the fake treatment date $(k = 0)$ are statistically insignificant, and there is no consistent or sustained post-event pattern across subsequent years. This absence of treatment-like dynamics around the artificially shifted event supports the interpretation that the main event-study results are not driven by underlying trends or anticipatory behavior.\n",

    "Two pre-period coefficients $(k = -3)$ and $(k = -2)$ are mechanically equal to zero in both specifications, reflecting a lack of data support in those bins after shifting and window restriction rather than meaningful economic effects. In the baseline specification, one post-period coefficient $(k = 3)$ appears statistically significant; however, this effect disappears once controls are included and does not form part of a coherent dynamic pattern. Overall, the shifted-event placebo reinforces the conclusion that the observed increase in net income margin at the time of system entry is tied to the actual treatment timing rather than spurious dynamics."
